        <h3> The Last Run </h3>
        <img src="the last run.png">
        <p> https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/258846629/ </p>
        <p> The premise of The Last Run revolves around Hannah, a girl who is <br>
        trying her best to run away from the evil principal looking for late students <br>
        to tardy sweep. I implemented a scoring system based on time that she survives.<br>
        The use of randomness can be seen in position of the door. The player loses <br>
        once they come in contact with Wanda, or the evil principal. </p>
        
        <p> The game was inspired by the everyday school environemnt. Two successful <br>
        in creation of the game was the movement and the visual aspect of it. Two obstacles <br>
        were figuring out how to use the given variables and also how to figure out <br>
        how their use will affect my game. I overcame them by spending a lot more time <br>
        on it. If I had more time, I would implement different levels of difficulties <br> 
        to the game </p>

        <h3 id= "python"> Unrealistic Dating Story </h3>
        <p>     The premise of the game talks about the dating experience of a young <br> 
        individual and his pursuit of a girl. The selection of choices presented <br>
        to the user allows them to choose their own stories. It follows the <br>
        journey from the moment in which Dave, the character in which the user <br>
        is controlling, first met the girl until the ending. In which Dave could <br> 
        end up getting to know her even more, or ending up not getting the chance <br>
        to interact with her at all <br> </p>

        <img src = "unrealistic.png" > </a>
        <p> A series of various different if statements were used  in order to layer <br>
        different scenes and to connect them all together. A way in which to determine <br>
        the validity of the user's inputs was through a series of while loops, that if their <br>
        input did not follow the possible choices, that they will be prompted to <br>
        enter a valid input instead(ie. Entering an invalid number input prompts user to <br>
        enter valid letter input. This checking mechanism allows for overall smoothness <br>
        of the program, in which it will minimize the risk of the program encountering <br>
        an error due to the invalidity of the input. However, due to the time constrain <br>
        that we weren't able to include of all the elements of our storyboard into it. <br>
        Independenly, I was responsible for the half of the storyline</p>
        
        <p>     It was a form of procedural abstraction because it allows for maximum <br>
        clarity in terms of being able to follow the various different scenes required <br>
        for this project, both during and post-development.  <br> </p>
        
        
        <p>     A story that really stood out was A Lover's Quarrel. I <br>
        liked it because of the clear storyline and also of the way it was <br>
        presented in a manner that was very easy to follow. Another one <br>
        that I like was The Advanture of Spider Ham, I liked it because of the light-hearted nature of <br>
        it, and also because it was not dense of text like some other programs. </p>

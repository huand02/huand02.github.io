        <h3> The Last Run </h3> <br>
        <img src="the last run.png">
        <p> https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/258846629/ </p>
        <p> The premise of The Last Run revolves around Hannah, a girl who is <br>
        trying her best to run away from the evil principal looking for late students <br>
        to tardy sweep. I implemented a scoring system based on time that she survives.<br>
        The use of randomness can be seen in position of the door. The player loses <br>
        once they come in contact with Wanda, or the evil principal. </p>
        <p> ____________________________________________________________________ <br> </p> 
        <p> The game was inspired by the everyday school environemnt. Two successful <br>
        in creation of the game was the movement and the visual aspect of it. Two obstacles <br>
        were figuring out how to use the given variables and also how to figure out <br>
        how their use will affect my game. I overcame them by spending a lot more time <br>
        on it. If I had more time, I would implement different levels of difficulties <br> 
        to the game </p>
